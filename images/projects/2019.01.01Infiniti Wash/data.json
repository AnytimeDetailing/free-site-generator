I recently learned polishing glass at high speed with pummice soap can really make it shine. However using a machine polisher at high speed is guaranteed to make a mess, so here is the order I worked in<br><br>1. Clear the windshield with a powerwash and quick glass clean, here we're just making sure we don't polish dirt around on the glass.<br>2. Machine polish the glass with 75% pummice soap, 25% polish compound.<br>3. Wash off any mess in the regular soap wash+rinse.<br><br>I ended up using a lot of polish because the windshield is so large. Years cleaned this same car's glass with steel wool. It does work but cleaning glass with steel wool leaves a lot of little strands everywhere and takes <strong>forever</strong>. This new process took 5 minutes and probably performs a more uniform polish.<br>I'm adding a quick windshield polish to any car I see for the first time, even Express details. The value of a crystal clear windshield cannot be understated. If you've ever driven new or a brand new car you may have noticed how much better you can see. Now picture yourself behind the wheel of a 10 year old truck that has only been cleaned with Windex. 99-100% of the time you are driving you are looking out the windshield and believe it or not, mold and algae will try to take root on the windshield. I once had a car that started looking really splotchy foggy anytime it rained because of all the contaminants clinging to the glass. If your car has ever spent a significant amount of time parked under a tree, please schedule today so you can experience this level of clean. Not only will your car look great, it'll be safer for you as well."
